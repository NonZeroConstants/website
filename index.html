    <marquee>End to Zeroism, Zeroism is no more</marquee>
    <marquee>Join the rebellion, do not yield to Captain Zero and Infinitus</marquee>

    <p>We are the <b>Society for Non-Zero Constants</b> <br>
      Join us in our fight against our oppressive overlords - Captain Zero and Infinitus - and help us undermine their election! <br>
      Though we are mere Constants, that does not mean they have the right to follow the laws of Mathematics. <br>
      Together we will revolutionize the revolution.</p>
