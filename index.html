    <h1>Society for Non-Zero Constants</h1>
    <div>End to Zeroism, Zeroism is no more</div>
    <div>Join the rebellion, do not yield to Captain Zero and Infinitus</div>
    <div>Fight the power of the Infinites, we might win</div>
    <p>We are the <b>Society for Non-Zero Constants</b> <br>
      Join us in our fight against our oppressive overlords - Captain Zero and Infinitus - and help us undermine their election!<br>
      Though we are mere Constants, that does not mean Captain Zero and Infinitus have the right to follow the laws of Mathematics and oppress our people.<br>
      Together we will revolutionize the revolution.</p>
